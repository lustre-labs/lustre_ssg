// TYPES -----------------------------------------------------------------------

/// The `Config` type tells `lustre_ssg` how to generate your site. It includes
/// things like the output directory and any routes you have configured.
/// 
/// The type parameters are used to track different facts about the configuration
/// and prevent silly things from happening like building a site with no guaranteed
/// routes.
/// 
/// If you're looking at the generated documentation on hex.pm, these type parameters
/// will be unhelpfully labelled "a", "b", "c", etc. Here's a look at what these
/// type parameters are called in the source code:
/// 
/// ```
/// pub opaque type Config(
///   has_static_routes,
///   has_static_dir,
///   use_index_routes
/// )
/// ```
/// 
/// - `has_static_routes` indicates whether or not the configuration has at least
///   one static route and so is guarnateed to generate at least one HTML file.
///   It will be either `HasStaticRoutes` or `NoStaticRoutes`.
/// 
///   You need to add at least one static route before you can build your site
///   using [`build`](#build). This is to prevent you from providing empty dynamic
///   routes and accidentally building nothing.
/// 
/// - `has_static_dir` indicates whether or not the configuration has a static
///   assets directory to copy. It will be either `HasStaticDir` or `NoStaticDir`.
/// 
///   The [`build`](#build) function will run regardless, but you may choose to
///   wrap this function yourself to provider stricter compile-time guarantees
///   if you want to ensure that your static assets are always configured.
/// 
/// - `use_index_routes` indicates whether or not the configuration will generate
///   HTML files that correspond directly to the route provided or if an index.html
///   file will be generated at the route provided. It will be either `UseDirectRoutes`
///   or `UseIndexRoutes`.
/// 
///   As with `has_static_dir`, the [`build`](#build) function will run regardless,
///   but you may use this parameter for stricter compile-time guarantees.
